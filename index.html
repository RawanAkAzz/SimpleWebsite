      <h1>Welcome To Programming</h1>
      <p>
        programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of
        instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages
        are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most
        programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are
        programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather
        than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the invention of
        the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute
        player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad,
        during the Islamic Golden Age.[1] Since the early 1800s, programs have
        been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms,
        music boxes and player pianos.[2] The programs for these machines (such
        as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in
        response to different inputs or conditions.

      <h1>Why is Programming Important</h1>
      <p>
        Programming is important for speeding up the input and output processes
        in a machine. Programming is important to automate, collect, manage,
        calculate, analyze the processing of data and information accurately.
        Programming is important to create software and applications that help
        computer and mobile users in daily life. Due to all these reasons, it’s
        really important to learn how to use programming languages in our daily
        life.

      <h1>Programming Quotes</h1>
      <p>
        “when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather
        than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so create.” ―
        Why The Lucky Stiff
      </p>
      <p>
        “Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to
        build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to
        produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.” ―
        Rick Cook

        Without knowing exactly what you are doing in trying to learn
        programming one can’t say if you are doing something wrong or not. The
        following may or may not at all apply to you, without further details on
        your method of learning programming it’s impossible to say.
